# FIZZ

Just my for-fun pseudo project which is supposed to be an RTOS like thing and also provide some sort of a standard library for STM32L476. I do not plan to support any other controllers as this project is just for me. If it ever becomes something decent i will make it "cross-platform".

It uses CMake to build and requires the GNU ARM toolchain (arm-none-eabi-gcc)
